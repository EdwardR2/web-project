  <p>  I know what my problem is. I get attached, fast. And once I'm attached to someone, I do everything I can to please them. It's never been about what I want, it's always everyone's needs before my own. I give out too many chances to people who, quite frankly, do not deserve them. They take advantage of me, and I become a pushover, But I'm okay with that, because they're in my life and that's all I ever wanted. And even if they screw me over, I'll still be there for them. Because that's me, that's who I am. Once I get attached to someone, they capture my heart and the yalways have a place there. And that's why it's so hard for me to let them go.
